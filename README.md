# os_in_rust
## Short introduction
Main purpose of this repository is to learn how to create OS from scratch for desired CPU architecture.

## Notes
- Repository containing operating system written in Rust and based on tutorial from here: https://os.phil-opp.com/
- All code was developed under MacOS environment. I think it should works as it is on Linux-based environment.
## Very short 'How To'
I've created `Makefile` with some common commands I'm using the most.
- `compile_qemu` just compiles code for QEMU emulator
- `compile_and_run` compiles code for QEMU and starts the emulator
